# Virtual Safari
I have encountered this project recently and remembered how much fun I had with this DVD game in my youth.  I have implemented the ability to play the Boat tour and also the Virtual Safari games from Lion King 1.5 and Lion King 2.0 DVDs.  Commandline tool FFMPEG came in great handy in trimming videos clips to the tenth of seconds for effective transitions.  Notes below here, with the exception of the live link to my version of the file, were the notes preserved by the original author of the project.

This project is a recreation of the Pumba and Timone Virtual Safari Jeep Tour, an interactive "choose-your-own-adventure" from the *The Lion King* bonus DVD.

## How it Works
When you press the "Start Journey" button, the first video of the experience will begin. Our hosts on the safari, Pumbaa and Timone, will guide the journey and prompt you, the player, when to make a choice of which direction to take the Jeep. At this time, the video will exit fullscreen and two corresponding buttons will appear that can either be clicked or tapped to play the next video.

All you have to do is to play along and have fun!

## Why did I make this?
Before completing the program, the only "playable" version was people's recordings of the game on YouTube.
I wanted to bring this interactive experience which was near and dear to my heart into an online format where the ability to influence and play the game is possible.
